🌟 Hello, I'm Jordan, and I'd like to extend a warm welcome to @ninetailstudio. 🌟

💼 Valuable Experience: My journey has been far from conventional. Over 8 years in the army, working at UPS, and engaging in retail sales, I've accumulated a wealth of diverse experiences. These varied roles, combined with exposure to different organizations, have sharpened my ability to comprehend human behavior and operation.

🚀 Streamlined Workflow Solutions: Along the way, I encountered generic, sluggish, and inefficient web platforms, even with my technical background. It's this firsthand understanding that drove me to establish @ninetailstudio, with the aim of offering:

🤝 Collaborative Success: I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with other businesses to optimize their workflow, boost sales, and enhance team experiences. I firmly believe that a contented team is a productive one. I offer my expertise to tackle complex issues with custom software solutions designed specifically for your company's requirements.

🌐 Customized Solutions: @ninetailstudio operates on the principle that each company deserves a tailor-made web solution. No more struggling with complex systems or juggling multiple platforms. My objective is to draw on the wisdom gained from diverse experiences to create functional web solutions.

🔍 Pursuit of Excellence: In a world that often settles for one-size-fits-all solutions, I adhere to a different standard. My commitment to continuous learning and knowledge-sharing drives me to push boundaries.

🏍 Beyond Code Passions: My life isn't solely focused on coding. Dive into the world of art with me or join me on a motorcycle ride. These passions keep me grounded and fuel my creativity, adding a unique touch to every project.

🌐 Open Source Philosophy: I firmly believe in the true spirit of Open Source – the freedom to customize, use, and share code. This philosophy leads me to prefer the MIT license over the GNU. I believe that true freedom in the Open Source world should empower everyone without unintentional restrictions.

💡 Web Realities: The web, with all its quirks, holds immense power. While I may have a nostalgic fondness for the efficiency of a C++ program, I understand that businesses thrive through the web. My dedication lies in mastering this platform comprehensively, ensuring that every solution is not only functional but also grounded in solid knowledge. And yes, aesthetics matter; I make sure they look good too!
